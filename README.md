Project one requires HTML and CSS structure that follows correct syntax. My website is created for cat moms and medical experts to reference. In effect, my hope is to give cat moms comfort in the possibilities of what is going on with their cat. I used HTML, CSS, and snippets of Bootstrap 5. I also designed the company logo for Check Meow-t for authenticity. 

I would like to develop functioning javascript for symptoms connected to health conditions, global vet finder based on users location, and a community page where users can comment and interact with their own tips in a Check Meow-t community.
